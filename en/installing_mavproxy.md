# Installing MAVProxy
Mavproxy is a tool we will use to analyse and control the flight logs. You will need to have Python 2.7 installed first. MAVProxy is hosted on PyPi and the installation packages can be found there: [MAVProxy](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MAVProxy) and [MAVLink](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymavlink).

##Linux
Linux users can use the PyPi program to get the needed packages:
